# Chapter 0: From Zero To One
---
## Summary
---
Microprocessors have transformed technology and society over the past few decades. This book guides you to design and build your own microprocessor, starting from basic digital logic gates up to programming in assembly.
## 0.1 The Game Plan

### Key Concepts
- **Book goal**:
  - Teach how to design/build a microprocessor.
  - Prepare for designing other digital systems.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Basic electricity knowledge.
  - Some programming experience.
  - Interest in low-level computer workings.
- **Approach**:
  - Start with logic gates (operating on 1s and 0s).
  - Build adders, memories from gates.
  - Learn assembly language programming.
  - Combine all to build a working microprocessor.
- **Key theme**:
  - Managing complexity by combining simple building blocks.
### Core Ideas
- Digital systems operate on binary values (1s and 0s), simplifying design.
- No need for advanced math or physics, but logic and organization are critical.
- Microprocessor design is a complex system-building challenge, requiring stepwise abstraction.
- Learning microprocessor design equips you for broader digital design challenges.

### Notable Quotes
> “A microprocessor may be the first system that you build that is too complex to fit in your head all at once."
### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don’t underestimate the complexity even though basic building blocks are simple.  
- Ensure you understand binary logic thoroughly before progressing.
